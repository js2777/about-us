## Working within a group   
1) Get one member of your group to create a copy of this repository   
2) They do this by going to + tab and select import repository
and use this link https://github.com/mfernandes61/Rres_about_us/tree/main    
3) Then go to General - Collaborators and add the other members of your group as editors.   
4) Now Group members create entries about themselves (mini bio) in a branch and then merge into main branch when done. (e.g. group 1 makes entries for group 1)     
5) Refresh web-page a few times until changes are propogated.   

## Working from outside of a group   
1) Work with another group e.g. group 1 with group 2   
2) Use Forking to add your bios to the next section and then propose a merge to other groups page.
